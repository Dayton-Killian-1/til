# Time to Catch Up

This class has been pretty heavy for me, and I let myself get behind. Today I'm going to try to catch up as much as I can, and I'm hoping to be up to date by class next week.

Some useful code helpers I can use to simplify my code:
- When passing an argument to a symbol, I can assign it directly by putting the colon on the right side.
- Parenthesis aren't required if I'm only using one argument in the line
- On the routes file, I can pass the route to the "/" symbol
- For the homepage, I'll just use the ```root``` method, followed by a string with the controller and action

Have to get back into class, and I'll resume this after.
