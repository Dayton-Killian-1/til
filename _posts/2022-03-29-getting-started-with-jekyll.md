# Dev Notes
## _Getting started with Markdown_

This is my first experience with Markdown, and I'm still getting familiar with everything. I'm a little nervous that I'm going to be lagging behind some fo the other people in this class, but it'll be okay as long as I can work hard.

There are a couple of projects that I'm interested in:
- Building a chess website that can run games via read/write APIs on Lichess or Chess.com
- Building my own website (daytonkillian.com)
- Getting ready to start my own projects
